## What is Virtual Learning Lab?
Virtual Learning Lab is a virtual reality game designed to mimic physical school/courses as best as possible, but with the added benefits of virtual reality. This way I want to make online school even better then real life school.

## How can you help?
I can use all the help to build this game. So if you want to help me create this game and improve online school then take a look at the issues and milestones. If you have a suggestion for the game you can create an isseu.
