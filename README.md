## What is Virtual Learning Lab?
Virtual Learning Lab is an open-source virtual reality game designed to mimic physical school/courses as best as possible, but with the added benefits of virtual reality. This way we want to make online school even better then real life school.

## What makes Virtual Learning Lab useful?
Virtual Learning Lab allows students to learn together no matter where they are. Not only that, but Virtual Learning Lab also allows students to learn in ways they never could before. This includes going back to medieval times and being there as they invade a castle.
